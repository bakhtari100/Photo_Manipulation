# Photo Manipulation

This project provides tools for basic image manipulation, including brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, kernel application, and image I/O operations. 
It is built using Python and NumPy for efficient numerical operations.

## Features

- **Image Class**:
  - Read and write PNG images.
  - Store image data as a 3D NumPy array for easy manipulation.

- **Transformations**:
  - Adjust brightness and contrast of images.
  - Apply kernels for effects like blurring or sharpening.
  - Perform pixel-wise operations for custom transformations.

## File Structure

- `image.py`: Contains the `Image` class for reading, writing, and storing image data.
- `transform.py`: Includes functions for manipulating images, such as adjusting brightness, contrast, and applying kernels.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/photo_manipulation.git
